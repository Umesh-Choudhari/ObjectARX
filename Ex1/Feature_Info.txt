1.Created a new ObjectARX project in Microsoft Visual Studio as an MFC (Microsoft Foundation Classes) Dynamic Link-Library (DLL) with a DLL extension.
2.This sets up the project structure for developing AutoCAD applications.
3.Configured the Project for ObjectARX:
4.Configured the project to build an ObjectARX application by making necessary changes in the C++ and Linker properties.
5.This involves setting the necessary compilation and linking options to enable ObjectARX development.
6.Added Required Libraries:
7.Added all required libraries in the project's properties settings.
8.This includes linking against the ObjectARX libraries and any other dependencies needed for developing AutoCAD applications.
9.Defined acrxEntryPoint Function:
10.Defined the acrxEntryPoint function. This function serves as the entry point for the ObjectARX application.
11.It handles initialization and unloading messages, such as AcRx::kInitAppMsg and AcRx::kUnloadAppMsg.
12.Implemented Command for Message Display:
13.Implemented code to display the message "Hello in the world of AutoCAD" when the command "MYCOMMAND" is entered in AutoCAD. 
14.This involves defining a custom command function (e.g., MyCommand) and registering it using acedRegCmds->addCommand.
15.In summary, the described steps outline the process of creating an ObjectARX project, configuring it for AutoCAD development, adding necessary libraries, 
   defining the entry point function, and implementing a custom command to display a specific message in the AutoCAD environment.
